# Going Beyond Virtual Reality
### This is why we Exist
- Human presence is the foundation of connection, learning, and collaboration — yet distance remains one of the greatest barriers in how we share experience. This represents hundreds of billions of market cap.
- Augmented and Virtual Reality is antiquated. Data now proliferates in ways that can enhance capability and redefine it.
- We need to move from a world of cumbersome, dystopian forms of immersive experience that are unable to blend into the world we live in, to seamless architectures that improve our quality of life and make people more productive.
- Holograms can deliver incomparable levels of clarity and empathetic depth, supporting encounters that significantly expand the reaches of human connection, collaboration, and creativity.
- Incumbents ignore the need for root, whole-picture innovation beyond that which is capable of contemporary VR or AR. This form of innovation must be engineered and it must emerge from the United States.

##### ***It is important that this occurs in parallel to AI's advent. We work on the bet that agentic autonomy is an important accelerant towards highly emotionally resonant holograms, that compounds user experience.***

##### Holographic display systems that are capable of extremely immersive spatial reconstruction and capture are made in our eyes by the command of laser projection upon ambient air, enabled by the exploitation of laminar flow. In the context of holographic interfaces at large, optical clarity is best achieved through high-fidelity volumetric projection upon gaseous flow at Reynold's (Re) <2,300, with transition turbulent at Re 2,550 - 2,900 cast, rather than any approach that is not gaseous in nature, or that is screen-based, headset-constrained, or reliant on two-dimensional proxies of presence such as a swept-medium. We believe the hologram is primitive in its current condition; and as we release over time, in terms of hardware, software, and user experience, we will stance standards of general-purpose forkability.

##### [Vicarious Devices Corporation](https://www.vicariousdevices.com/) is an early-stage startup company founded in 2025. We develop hardware and software architectures that function to stand new mediums of immersive reality, capable of the long-term succession of modern interface approaches. We see the challenges ahead of us not as barriers, but as invitations to create enduring solutions that have the ability to alter how we interface between the digital and physical world. Our architectures are designed to render alternative interface approaches impractical by comparison. We do see our architectures as a template for others to follow — hence our existence on this site — and we invite others to follow. We work to introduce technologies that displace weight such that our industry advances as a whole.

### This is why you've reached GitHub
##### You're here for one of three reasons - 1) You know our systems well, 2) You know us well, or 3) You want to know what we do. We've moved our real-time presence to GitHub in order to maximize transparency and because we believe in the concept of open-source documentation. On this repository and those that accompany it, you will see how things change over time, you can suggest improvements, or even take some of our ideas and make them your own to create something useful in other contexts. You can also rely on these repositories to more quickly access support and better learn how our hardware and our software operates, before, during, or after you decide to give our systems a try. We're grateful you may take the time to read these repositories to learn more about us, and we want to extend that extra layer of trust by making it more accessible for everyone here on GitHub.

### Join Us
##### Internship — We run programs in Miami, next starting January 2026. Please reach out to team members individually if interested.
##### Most roles at Vicarious are engineering-oriented as we are a startup company working to solve fundamentally challenging problems. Our interns are intended to be prepared to enter full-time roles following their internship or external positions at companies like [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) or [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com). We are location and education agnostic. We do not care if you come from [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu) or [MIT](https://www.mit.edu), but we do care if you are good. Do not feel you need experience to apply, we encourage you to apply regardless. We are often the first internship on resume, and we are proud to be that first 'yes'. For full-time opportunities, [email us](mailto:c@vicariousdevices.com) what you're good at.
##### (While we look for many engineers, we do recognize talent where we see it. Please reach out if you believe another role could be useful to our mission)

### Questions?
##### You can reach us regarding any technical, corporate, or production related matters [here](mailto:c@vicariousdevices.com).
##### For more urgent matters that require immediate assistance, visit the Manual for [documentation](https://github.com/Vicarious-Devices/Manual) or contact c@vicariousdevices.com.
##### (Chances are we can answer your question faster by this Manual, e.g., "how do I diagnose this issue?", so we try to keep it easy to navigate)
