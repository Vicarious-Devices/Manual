## Our Ethos

Our team works to cultivate the field of holographic interaction and, by proxy, introduce the most significant advancements in human–machine experience of our generation. By mission; to create unparalleled systems that propel enterprise and consumer productivity and bridge gaps between the digitial and physical world.

We are relentless in our pursuit of lifelike expression. We reject the dystopian future of headsets, glasses, and further separation. We leverage artificial intelligence in sequence with advanced optical, acoustic, and volumetric projection to support our concept of presence. We view these challenges as calls to innovate, compelling us to build platforms that make immersion natural, empathy tangible, and collaboration spatial. Vicarious exists to lead the transition beyond virtual reality — toward true reality, this one.

We harness the transformative power of such innovations to create moments of extraordinary emotional and visual depth, and invite the world to witness us.

## What is Vicarious?

[Vicarious Devices, Inc.](https://www.vicariousdevices.com/) is structured to drive innovation and excellence in holographic display systems and embodied artificial intelligence. Founded in 2025, we are an early-stage company headquartered in the United States, comprised of engineers, industry veterans and autonomous agents. We are conviction-led and founder-led, as well as the first to have bet on the concept of laminar-airflow projection as the foundation for the practical hologram and real-world telepresence, due to our recognition of it as the most [visually stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)) method to sustain imagery cast upon ambient air.

Our organizational structure is designed to foster rapid integration and agility. We believe strongly in the concept of iterative design and recursive development — we examine and test every concept in the real world to determine what survives in reality, placing each option in competition with another framed by user experience (UX) optimization, guided by empirical observation and sympathetic adaptability. We believe in [modular design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design) heavily, and operate distinct internal units for hardware interfaces, sensory and spatial capture, and modular firmware, which interchange capabilities as concepts mature, ensuring our platforms evolve continuously rather than obsolesce. Our offerings are built to adapt — not to age — advancing in fidelity and depth over time.

Our research and development (R&D) department is our creative and technical core. These units are responsible for pioneering holographic architectures for direct deployment in enterprise and consumer environments. They work closely with experts across optics, acoustics, and spatial computing to continuously refine and reimagine the frontier of human perception.

The production department at Vicarious handles the assembly, Q/A and checkout of holographic systems. This team ensures that our systems are manufactured to exacting standards of quality and are capable of meeting the demands of performance and fidelity expected of our customers in the enterprise and consumer sectors.

As we are still small and nimble, every system deployed in field is supported by direct support from an engineer that worked to engineer and build your exact serial number, working with an intricate understanding of interface and backend, to ensure that our systems are implemented effectively and fit in seamlessly.

In addition to our internal structure, Vicarious has a strong focus on partnerships and collaboration. We work with leading academic institutions, research organizations, and industry partners to stay ahead of the curve and continuously improve our offerings.

Our corporate culture is built on a foundation of innovation, excellence, and responsible stewardship. We encourage our team members to think creatively, reject superficiality, and work to replace spectacle with substance. This culture of depth is what drives us forward and supports our stance as the leader of our field.

## How we support community and leverage partners

We see our architectures as products but also as templates for others to follow, which is why we embrace transparency and open-source principles. By sharing insights, we enable the broader community to build upon our work, driving collective progress in the hologram industry.

We work to introduce technologies that displace weight and advance the industry as a whole. This commitment to innovation and community engagement is why we have established our presence on GitHub. We are here to maximize transparency and to embody our belief in open-source documentation; this is also where our operator's manuals will be published.

On this repository and those that accompany it, you will see how our technologies evolve over time. We invite you to suggest improvements, to take our ideas and adapt them to create something useful in other contexts, or to simply learn more about our hardware and firmware. This open-access approach allows you to more quickly access support and better understand your system before, during, or after you decide to use them.

We actively support community engagement through open-source initiatives, to help make these technologies more accessible to a broader audience. By sharing our research and best practices, we work to promote transparency and encourage collaborative development. This approach empowers both individuals and organizations to push the boundaries of what is possible in our industry, which we will too benefit from seeing. Our partnerships extend to academic institutions as well; we support research initiatives and provide opportunities for students to engage in real-world research + development.

We are committed to promoting industry standards and best practices in both enterprise and consumer hologram deployment. By participating in industry consortiums and working groups, we help shape guidelines and protocols that ensure safety, quality, and responsibility across the sector. Our involvement in these initiatives ensures that our technologies align with responsible practice and contribute to the overall advancement of the industry.

Supporting our local community and promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is another core aspect of our mission. Through outreach programs, school partnerships, and public outreach, we aim to inspire and educate the next generation of innovators. By supporting local education initiatives and providing a platform for hands-on learning, we work to help cultivate a skilled workforce that will drive even more ambitious future advancements in the industry.

In conclusion, Vicarious' commitment to supporting the community and leveraging strategic partnerships is central to our overarching mission. By embracing open-source principles, fostering collaboration, and engaging with a diverse network of partners, we work to create a vibrant ecosystem that benefits not only our organization but the industry as a whole.

## What we aren't

We are not Meta. We are not Apple. We are what they forgot to imagine.
