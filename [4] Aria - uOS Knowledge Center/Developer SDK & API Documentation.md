## Overview

Welcome to the Vicarious uOS Developer SDK and API Documentation.  
This guide provides developers, integrators, and researchers with the technical foundations required to build, extend, and integrate directly with **uOS**, the unified operating system powering all Vicarious holographic systems.

The Vicarious uOS SDK enables programmatic control of projection parameters, real-time agent behaviors, and integration with external API, audio, and sensor backends. It is designed for developers who wish to create applications, experiences, and extensions that operate natively within the Vicarious environment.

## Introduction to uOS

uOS (you Operating System) is the firmware layer responsible for commanding every component of the Vicarious hardware stack: optical projection, flow management, audio capture, agent interaction, and environmental perception.

Through uOS, developers can:
- Control holographic projection parameters in real-time.
- Interface with the internal API and uOS modules.
- Stream volumetric data across local or cloud networks.
- Integrate additional capabilities through external backends.

## System Architecture

An overview of how uOS is structured:

1. **Core Layer** — manages device I/O, calibration, and environmental telemetry.  
2. **Interaction Layer** — processes agentic, audio, gesture, and capture telemetry.  
3. **Network Layer** — enables streaming and data synchronization between local and remote devices.  
4. **API Gateway** — provides REST, WebSocket, and gRPC interfaces for developers.  
5. **Sandbox Environment** — allows safe runtime execution of third-party plugins.
