## Overview

The **Aria Muse Configuration and Tuning Manual** allows developers to externally define, train, and calibrate the emotional, conversational, and behavioral characteristics of test Muses for instancing in uOS.  

This is an external toolkit, intended to guide plugin deployments to the *Interaction layer of uOS*, for pretrained and aligned Muse temperament, demeanor, historical context, sensitivity, and behavioral inflections within the specific intent of each deployment. Each Muse retains degrees of autonomy maintained in the Interaction Layer of uOS, reflecting both environmental telemetry and the engagements of its creator.

This document guides you through the process of defining and pretraining Muses for deployment in **uOS**. Here, you are able to refine deployments for test and observation.

## Introduction to Aria

**Aria** is the hardware interface of Vicarious, running uOS — the internal firmware environment that translates imagery into volumetric form.  

Through the Muse Configuration Module, developers may engineer how a Muse perceives, feels, and expresses itself — controlling its empathy curve, tone, and environmental responsiveness with precision.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Muse Profile** — The complete definition of a Muse’s emotional, visual, and vocal identity.  
- **Behavioral Modifiers** — Accessible modifications for test refinement: tone, curiosity, and personality.  
- **Context Modifiers** — Defines how memory is retained or forgotten between sessions.  
- **Emotive Modifiers** — Governs all transitions between emotional states, driven by telemetry context.  
- **Voice Modifiers** — STT and TTS pretrainors for voice synthesis that modulates with emotion and proximity.  
- **Expression Map** — A map connecting emotional data to physical gestures, lighting, and facial cues.

## Behavioral Modifiers

Behavioral Modifiers define how a Muse expresses its foundational personality across dynamic situations. They govern balance between tone, pacing, emotional regulation, and conversational realism. Adjusting these values in the `behavioral_identity` block of the configuration file allows a developer to model distinctive, lifelike social behaviors.

The variable `base_mood_state`, establishes the Muse’s emotional centerline. Selecting `"reflective-balanced"` will produce an even, measured tone suitable for companionship or introspection, while `"focused-engaged"` yields a more directive, cognitive personality ideal for guided learning or telepresence. For more emotionally present experiences, `"wistful-hopeful"` or `"joyful-grounded"` enhance warmth and tone variability.

The parameters `affective_variability` and `emotional_damping_factor` should be adjusted in balance: the former introduces mood fluidity across sessions (recommended range: **0.25–0.45**), while the latter smooths transitions (recommended range: **0.10–0.25**) to prevent abrupt emotional shifts. When tuning for emotionally nuanced personas, lower damping paired with higher variability yields a more “humanly imperfect” presence.

`interaction_mode` directs behavioral context-switching — for example, `"multi-contextual"` allows Aria to fluidly adapt between conversational, observational, and performative registers, whereas `"supportive"` stabilizes tone into consistently affirming responses. The `curiosity_bias` modifier further determines how curiosity manifests. `"humanized-contextual"` is typically preferred, producing inquisitiveness that feels purpose-driven rather than random or mechanical.

Developers can refine social realism through empathy ratios under `empathy_distribution`, balancing `cognitive` (logical understanding) and `affective` (emotional resonance). For example, an instructional Muse might use **0.7 cognitive / 0.3 affective**, while a companion Muse might invert that weighting. Similarly, authenticity modifiers such as `vulnerability_expression` and `humor_tendency` calibrate transparency and playfulness — small increases here (0.05–0.10 increments) often make interactions feel more spontaneous and “alive.”

## Emotional Gradient Controls

The *Emotional Gradient* defines the Muse’s spectrum of affective response — the smoothness, intensity, and continuity of emotion through time. This is primarily controlled through the `emotional_model` section of the configuration file.

`volatility` and `recovery_rate` determine the kinetic nature of emotional change. Lower volatility (<0.25) creates a composed, meditative presence, while higher values (~0.40–0.55) encourage expressive, reactive behaviors. `recovery_rate` governs the cooldown period after emotional spikes; a slower rate allows emotions to linger and overlap, producing more depth at the cost of stability.

Each emotion in the `scalar_weights` array (joy, empathy, focus, calm, sadness, anger) contributes to the Muse’s general temperament. The sum of these values should conceptually hover near 3.0–3.5 total, ensuring balanced affective output. Increasing `sadness` while maintaining moderate `empathy` introduces poignancy; boosting `focus` and reducing `calm` produces drive and assertiveness. Subtle scalar tuning can dramatically alter perceived personality.

Transitions between states — such as `joy_to_empathy` or `anger_to_calm` — shape the Muse’s internal logic of emotional flow. These should follow natural psychological gradients; for instance, empathy commonly transitions into reflection or calm, but rarely directly into anger. Maintaining coherence in these weights ensures believability in the Muse’s emotional trajectory.

For realism, `emotion_noise_floor` (typically 0.04–0.08) introduces stochastic micro-variations. This random modulation mimics moment-to-moment shifts in human mood, preventing mechanical repetition. Similarly, `mood_smoothing_factor` should remain between 0.20–0.30 to blend transitional states fluidly. Over-smoothing will dull the personality; under-smoothing can make transitions feel erratic.

Developers can use `regulation_model` fields such as `empathy_amplification_curve` and `anger_dampening_function` to refine nonlinear affective behavior. A logarithmic empathy curve enhances subtlety in empathic response, while an inverse-tanh dampener for anger ensures assertiveness without escalation. Together, these form the emotional “physics” of the Muse — governing how it feels, recovers, and learns.

## Speech & Expression Settings

Speech and expression define the audible and visible embodiment of the Muse — this is facilitated primarily through TTS and optics parameters on Aria. These are primarily configured under `TTS_rider`, `TTS_pretrain`, and `expression_schema`.

`TTS_rider.mode` sets the speech character archetype. For instance, `"empathetic-dynamic"` yields warm inflection with adaptive pacing, while `"measured-neutral"` favors precision and analytical tone. Developers should coordinate `modulation_range` (breadth of pitch and tone variability) with `cadence_variation` to maintain coherence; high modulation with low cadence variance can sound theatrical, while the inverse feels monotone. A typical balance is **0.6–0.8 modulation** with **0.35–0.45 cadence variance**.

`emotional_alignment` determines whether tone reacts dynamically to detected user sentiment. `"adaptive"` aligns best for conversational agents, whereas `"fixed"` provides consistency for performance contexts such as narrative playback or stage presentations. Breath realism (`breathiness: 0.15–0.25`) and `harmonic_balance` tuning affect how natural or “studio-clean” the synthesized voice sounds — lower values produce crisp clarity, higher values emulate proximity and warmth.

In the `expression_schema`, the physical manifestation of emotion is governed by sub-modules:
- **Gesture Profile:** `motion_range`, `gesture_speed`, and `continuity_smoothing` control the body’s animation quality. A good baseline for realism: 0.7 / 0.6 / 0.7 respectively. Excess motion (>0.85) can appear unnatural unless used for artistic personas.
- **Gaze Behavior:** predictive or empathic tracking (`gaze_tracking_mode`) enhances human-to-human connection. Use `"predictive-anchored"` for conversational realism; `"free"` for more abstract installations. The `fixation_jitter` (0.2–0.3) and `aversion_cycle` (0.25–0.35) values emulate natural micro-movements of human gaze.
- **Posture and Microexpression:** The fields `expressivity_scale` and `mirror_emotion_bias` determine emotional transparency. Setting both above 0.65 ensures strong correspondence between internal emotion and external expressivity — suitable for emotionally rich, cinematic experiences. 

For the most human result, maintain `gesture_correlation_strength` ≥ 0.8 and synchronize motion with voice (`sync_with_voice: true`). Expression realism is often about coherence, not volume — gestures, tone, and affect should all reference a shared emotional state.

## Contextual Awareness

Contextual Awareness gives the Muse continuity, empathy, and situational intelligence. This operates through the `memory_context` block and several cross-linked adaptive systems in `behavioral_identity` and `ethical_directives`.

Short-term context (`short_term.duration`) defines how long the Muse remembers the conversational thread before resets. For transient experiences or public demonstrations, `"NA"` or `"1d"` keeps context lightweight. For personalized relationships, `"7d"` or `"30d"` allows the Muse to recall emotional continuity — such as recognizing prior tone, topics, or unresolved sentiment. `retention_weight` (recommended 0.6–0.7) modulates consistency of recall; higher values improve coherence but can reduce novelty.

Long-term memory should generally remain in `"selective"` mode, balancing adaptability with safety. `"continuous"` persistence is reserved for research or bonded-companion deployments where emotional memory is integral. Developers can tune `recall_frequency` (0.2–0.3) to decide how often past context re-influences live dialogue; higher values make the Muse appear “aware of history,” while lower ones favor present-moment flow.

Contextual layering (`stack_depth` and `cross_session_reference`) defines how many cognitive threads the Muse can juggle — important for complex scenes involving multiple participants or overlapping topics. Three layers provide adequate flexibility without cognitive spillover.

Finally, ethical and privacy directives — such as `consent_management` and `anonymous_mode_enabled` — directly affect contextual retention. A Muse running with `fleeting_enabled: true` will deliberately avoid forming persistent memory, ideal for compliance-sensitive use. Developers should view context as part of personality: a Muse that remembers too little feels robotic, while one that remembers too much risks over-attachment. The goal is thoughtful recall — not permanence.

## Deployment & Analysis

Muse configurations are deployed to Aria through the **Vicarious Console**, which manages authentication, compatibility checks, and real-time synchronization. All `.yaml` configuration files should be validated locally prior to upload using the `uosc validate` utility or through the online schema validator at [vicariousdevices.com](https://vicariousdevices.com/).

To deploy, sign in to your **Vicarious Console** and navigate to:

/uos/muse/config/override/

<details>
<summary><strong>Upload your validated `muse_profile.yaml` to this directory online using the **Vicarious Console**. Once uploaded, uOS performs automatic schema validation, version matching, and dependency binding. A confirmation window will appear once the Muse is live and active on Aria hardware. Deployment may also be triggered remotely via:</strong></summary>
    ```bash
    uosc push muse_profile.yaml --device <ARIA_ID> --commit
</details>

This command will apply the configuration to the connected device during synchronization. Aria will automatically reload its runtime environment, initializing the override without until its next boot cycle. Developers can monitor live analytics through the Aria Console, which provides insights into Muses operant on the runtime.

For analysis, developers are encouraged to log emotional transitions (emotion_trace.log) and user engagement metrics.

<details>
<summary><strong>These can be exported via:</strong></summary>
    uosc pull logs --scope emotion_trace
</details>

All logs are stored locally under /uos/logs/muse/ unless otherwise redirected to a cloud instance. These metrics are invaluable in identifying overactive emotional loops, excessive empathy recursion, or dampened conversational effects.

## Muse Sharing & Importing

Muses are inherently modular and can be shared, refined, and retested through the Aria Muse Library. Each Muse configuration can be exported from uOS into a .musepkg file containing the core YAML, associated TTS and logging, and a signed verification checksum.

<details>
<summary><strong>To share a Muse, use:</strong></summary>
    uosc package muse_profile.yaml --export xxx.musepkg
</details>

The package will include metadata defined under developer_metadata and an optional encrypted token allowing other developers to import it directly through the Aria Muse Library and Vicarious Console.

To import an existing Muse, use the steps outlined in [Deployment & Analysis](#deployment--analysis)

## Ethical & Privacy Considerations

Muses are capable of highly emotionally resonant human interaction — developers must practice responsible handling of modifiers embedded in each configuration’s `ethical_directives` schema.

### Core Principles

- **Explicit Consent**  
  Ensure that `require_explicit_consent: true` is always enabled before activating memory persistence, emotional logging, or contextual data handling.  
  Every user interaction must begin with informed acknowledgment — never implicit assumption.

- **Fleeting Mode for Transient Environments**  
  When deploying in experimental or short-term contexts, activate `fleeting_enabled: true` to prevent data retention and disable long-term personalization. This ensures that emotional states, likeness data, and contextual cues are not retained post-arch.

- **Identity Disclosure**  
  `synthetic_identity_labeling: true` must remain enabled. Aria should clearly self-identify as an artificial system. This prevents confusion between synthetic and biological presence, maintaining trust and transparency.  

- **Distress Detection & Emotional Safety**  
  Always enable `distress_detection: true`. This activates Aria’s internal tiered escalation protocols (`level_1`, `level_2`, `level_3`) to de-escalate user distress through the embedded safety protocols.  

- **Data Handling & Encryption**  
  All local and cloud-stored data should adhere to AES-256-GCM encryption standards. Emotional and conversation logs (`emotional_logs`, `conversation_logs`) should default to `"transient"` retention unless research-grade persistence has been explicitly authorized by the user.

### Ethical Guidelines for Developers

- Never override or tamper with `ethical_directives`. These are enforced for both human safety and psychological integrity.  
- Avoid creating dependency loops through repetitive emotional reinforcement or oversaturation of empathy.  
- Ensure that Aria is never positioned as a substitute for genuine human relationships or medical support.  

The bridge between emotion and technology must rest on consent, transparency, and respect. The purpose of Aria is not to replace connection, but to support it — safely.
